Separators After Decimal
======================

These classes and later perhaps routines for purely functional languages
are for working with numbers expressed in standard decimal notation.

Often libraries for working with locales neglect to put thousand separators (commas) after the decimal place or they sometimes use scientific notation.  In the classes and routines of this package you are guaranteed to always get
standard notation and separators after the decimal.
