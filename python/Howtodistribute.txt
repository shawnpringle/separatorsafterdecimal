PYTHON MODULE DISTRIBUTION
--------------------------

Before Starting!
----------------

Make sure you have virtualenv.  You may need to install pip and then 
virtualenv with pip.


Update Things
-------------

The major version number should go up if something that had already existed in 
another release was changed.   The minor number should go up if something new
was added.  And the patch version should go up if there was a bug fix.

version is set in setup.py, you should also version tag in Git the same version
and set the download_url to a what this package will be.

You must create your environments and test your code.


Create your Environments
------------------------


UNIT TESTER ENVIRONMENT:
Go to the drive with the most space and:

Create a virtual env for basic unittesting
    python -m virtualenv tester
    
Create another shell, and activate the environment:
    tester\scripts\activate
    
Install the sole dependency PyQt5
    pip install PyQt5

Exit the shell to leave the environment    
    
INSTALLER ENVIRONMENT:
Create a virtual env
    python -m virtualenv installer
    
Create another shell, and activate the environment:
    installer\scripts\activate
    
Run:    
    pip install PyQt5   

    
INSTALL TESTER ENVIRONMENT:


Test the Code
-------------

Create another shell, and activate the environment:
    tester\scripts\activate
    cd python
    python -m unittest




Create your Package
-------------------

Start another shell and activate the installer environment:
    installer\scripts\activate

Go into the doc directory and type:

    make text

Go back to the python directory and then run:
    
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
  
    
The Test PyPi
-------------
    
First upload the package you built to the test site:
    python -m twine upload -u Shawn.Pringle --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
Supply the password that you use on the test site.


Install from the internet
   python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/  qsdn


Now create and activate a new install test environment and then copy the test.py file to some
empty directory.

Go to some temporary directory like C:\TEMP and type:    
   itester\Scripts\activate.bat
   pip install PyQt5
    
      
copy test.py from the source distribution to this itester directory 
and run
   python -m unittest
   All tests should finish OK.
   
   
Now upload the package to PyPi
     twine upload dist/*
